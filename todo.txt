fix rendering emails, when i click on an emails its not working, 
tell it to give you fmt.println statments to debug the code as well as debug statements if any js is used. 
ask me to give you files based on imports rather than making them up. 

when i click on other folders it doesnt work, it need to load those emails 

you need to make and a threading algorithm, jwz algorithm to thread emails together, make as efficient as possible, 
use only a db that is built into go, we dont want to install anything other than go
